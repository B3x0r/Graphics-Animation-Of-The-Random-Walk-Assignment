# Graphics-Animation-Of-The-Random-Walk-Assignment
 
#### Description:

This was a week 3 assignment that is supposed to move 3 balls around the screen.
 
#### Installation:
 
I thought you could just copy the files into a folder on your device. Then, you drag the .html file and it into the url line. I cannot get that to work.
 
#### Usage:
 
According to NextTech this one works, but I can't get it to works. This doesn't apply right now.
 
#### Support: 
 
I still need support for this one.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 
I would like to get the balls to change colors when they hit the edges.
